//4. Which statement(s) are correct about the following code? (Choose all that apply)
//A. It will compile without issue.
//B. It fails to compile because the type of the exception the method throws is a subclass of
//the type of exception the parent method throws.
//C. It fails to compile because the return types are not covariant.
//D. It fails to compile because the method is protected in the parent class and public in
//the subclass.
//E. It fails to compile because of a static modifier mismatch between the two methods.
